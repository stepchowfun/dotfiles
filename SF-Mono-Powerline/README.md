![SF Mono Powerline](Prompt.png)

### Apple's gorgeous SF Mono font patched with [the Nerd Fonts patcher](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-patcher) for Powerline support.

Powerline glyphs allow for pretty and practical statuslines, as seen in [the original vim plugin](https://github.com/powerline/powerline) or in enhanced shell prompts like [Shellder](https://github.com/simnalamburt/shellder) (shown above) or [Starship](https://starship.rs).

Supported for macOS, Linux and Windows.

For personal use only.
