## Installation

Run this command:

```sh
curl https://www.stephanboyer.com/dotfiles -LSfs | sh
```

Then use [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty) as your terminal. The installer script downloads Alacritty and configures it to use the [Input Mono](https://input.fontbureau.com) font.

You can use another terminal emulator such as Terminal (macOS) and iTerm2, but you will have to configure it manually.

**NOTE:** The installer script will overwrite existing dotfiles and other configuration. Use at your own risk!
