[![Build status](https://github.com/stepchowfun/dotfiles/workflows/Continuous%20integration/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/stepchowfun/dotfiles/actions?query=branch%3Amain)

This repository contains various configuration files I use for my shell, text editor, terminal emulator, etc.

## Installation

Run this command:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stepchowfun/dotfiles/main/install.sh -LSfs | sh
```

**NOTE:** The installer script will overwrite existing dotfiles and other configuration. Use at your own risk!

## Notes

- The [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) terminal emulator is configured to use the [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/) typeface, but this font must be licensed and so cannot be automatically installed. You must either purchase the font or change the font family.
