## Installation

Run this command:

```sh
curl https://www.stephanboyer.com/dotfiles -LSfs | sh
```

Then use [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty) as your terminal. Other terminals such as Terminal (macOS) and iTerm2 are known to work, but the installer script only installs a configuration for Alacritty.

**NOTE:** The installer script will overwrite existing dotfiles and other configuration. Use at your own risk!
